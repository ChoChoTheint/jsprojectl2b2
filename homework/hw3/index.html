            <h2 class="faq-title">What is crochet</h2>
            <p class="faq-text">Most of us would have encountered crochet in some form or the other, whether as apparel or as accessories. The fine loop-like construction and the vibrant colors of the threads is an interesting way to break the monotony of items used for everyday fashion and living. It isn’t the name of the fabric itself, but rather, the process of creating fabric by interlocking loops of yarn, thread or strands of other materials using a hook. This name derives from French, meaning ‘small hook’.</p>

            <h2 class="faq-title">What is Crochet made of?</h2>
            <p class="faq-text">You can make crochet from materials such as metal, wood or plastic using a crochet hook. You can manufacture it commercially or produce it in artisan workshops.

            <h2 class="faq-title">The History of Crochet & its Origin</h2>
            <p class="faq-text">The word crochet first appeared in the Dutch magazine Penélopé in 1823. The Memoirs of a Highland Lady by Elizabeth Grant has the first English reference to garments made of cloth produced by looping yarn with a hook. Despite its English origins, there is evidence of a connection between French tambour embroidery and crochet. The former method of production was illustrated in detail in Diderot’s Encyclopedia, 1763. Several other books have frequently mentioned the use of ivory, bone, or wooden hooks and steel needles.
            Crochet was introduced in Ireland, in the 19th century, as a form of famine relief during the Great Irish Famine (1845–1849). Poverty-stricken Irish workers made money through the production of crocheted lace. Crocheting was also introduced in schools as part of the famine relief process. The craft reached the Americas with the migration of the Irish. Mademoiselle Riego de la Blanchardiere is credited with inventing Irish crochet. She published the first book of patterns in 1846. Irish lace became popular in Europe and America and was made in bulk until World War I</p>
